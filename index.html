		<h2>Who is Kylee Kincer?</h2>
		<p>I'm a 19 year old undergrad film major at NYU. Welcome to my website.</p>

		<h2>Family</h2>
		<p>I'm an only child, and I'm biracial. My dad is American and my mom is Peruvian. In total I have 11 cousins, and if you count second cousins and cousins once removed, I have 25+ cousins, mostly from my mom's side.</p>

		<h2>Childhood</h2>
		<p>I was born in Washington D.C. but I lived in Maryland. When I was three we moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, and a little after that we ended up in Westborough, which is where I grew up. It was nice and safe, but besides that it was pretty boring.</p>
		<p>Their high school was pretty good, but their science department in particular was known to have quite a few issues... and I'm not just saying that cause I was terrible at science, my friends who are currently studying in STEM fields have all had bad experiences.</p>
